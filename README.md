A favicon demo

a basic django app, launch it via http://127.0.0.1:8000/faviconfinder

Unfortunately I was able to get it deployed to a host yet, so the DB is not populated.  
It has an admin functionality to seed the DB from via downloaded zip.

It's a little clunky but if you select any user or Favicon Object (at least one much be selected) and choose the "Seed DB" action,
it will kick off the DB download and seeding operation.
